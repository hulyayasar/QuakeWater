# Inspiration ✨

Turkey and Syria are suffering one of the strongest earthquakes to hit the region since 1939. More than 40,000 people are believed to have died. Many of the survivors lost their homes or were unable to return to their homes due to unsafe conditions. Unfortunately, there is a need for clean water in earthquake areas. Our aim is to help earthquake victims, even a little. In addition, our purpose is to awareness among people about what happen in Turkey.

# What it does?💻📱

QuakeWater has been designed to help those whom earthquakes have impacted find the necessities of life. With our app, earthquake victims can quickly locate the nearest sources of water, restroom, and showers in their area, helping them and their loved ones stay healthy and clean in the aftermath of a disaster. Our app provides accurate and up-to-date information about available resources.

On the home page, there are options to select the need such as water, shower, and restroom. After that, the app will get the user's current location and provides the closest locations. Finally, the app will show you all the available sources with information on the current status.

# How we built it? 🦾

Firstly, we planned our project by creating frames of the application on paper. Then, we shared the app's pages between us to work collaboratively. Finally, we used HTML, and CSS by inspiring designs from Figma.

# Challenges we ran into 🚣🏻‍♂️

We had problems making our app responsive. Currently, it is only working for mobile app dimensions but we are planning to make it functional on the web app too.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of 👾

Firstly, we are excited to have a potential solution for an essential issue of accessing clean water. It is very valuable for us to have a chance to raise awareness about the situation in Turkey. Also, this is the first interactive mobile app that we created. It was a great experience to go through all the steps of creating a new project as a group.

# What we learned🪐

We learned to create and design a mobile app using HTML, and CSS. Also, we also gained experience in teamwork and brainstorming and improved our problem-solving skills.

# What's next for QuakeWater 👩🏻‍💻👩🏽‍💻

We are planning to add a database to our app to get up-to-date information and availability status from locations. Also, we would like to add a request form section so that people can make requests about their needs if there is help is not provided in that area yet.
